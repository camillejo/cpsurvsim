Description: This package allows the user to simulate survival data
    with type I right censoring using two methods: the inverse CDF
    method and our proposed memoryless method. The latter method
    takes advantage of the memoryless property of survival and
    simulates a separate distribution between change-points. We
    include two parametric distributions: exponential and Weibull.
